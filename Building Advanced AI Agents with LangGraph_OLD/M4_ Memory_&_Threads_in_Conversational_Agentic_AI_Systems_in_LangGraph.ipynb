He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.\\nMeta has a bunch of new hardware and AI news coming out of its Meta Connect event today, including a new Quest 3S VR headset, an expansion of Meta AI features, a new Llama model, and a first look at the new Orion augmented reality glasses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage on Wednesday with a new style and demonstrated new features including live translation between English and Spanish.\\nHere’s everything announced at Meta Connect:\\nOrion AR glasses\\n\\nPhoto by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\\nMeta has revealed its Orion augmented reality glasses, and they look almost like a trendy pair of frames you could pick up without all the tech inside. Orion uses Micro LED projectors inside the frame and beams images in front of your eyes via waveguides in the lenses. Orion has the same kinds of generative AI capabilities as the current Ray-Ban smart glasses — but adds a visual element to make it more helpful, like adding labels on top of ingredients you’re looking at on a table.\\nThe glasses pair with a wireless compute puck and a “neural wristband” you wear on your arm that responds to gestures like punches. Orion isn’t quite ready as a product, though, so it isn’t going on sale.\\nThe cheaper Quest 3S VR headset\\n\\nPhoto by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\\nMeta’s latest VR headset is the Quest 3S, and it’s launching at the Quest 2’s original starting price of $299.99. The new headset has many of the same features as the more expensive Quest 3, including the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip, and uses the same Touch Plus controllers. The lower price point is possible thanks to the Quest 3S’s lack of depth sensor, lower resolution screens, narrower field of view, and less compact package than the 3. With the 3S now in place, Meta is simplifying its VR lineup by discontinuing the Quest 2 and Quest Pro.\\nMeta’s Ray-Ban glasses add new features\\n\\nPhoto by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\\nMeta’s very cool Ray-Ban smart glasses are getting new software updates that add a Reminders feature that can help you keep track of your day like remembering your grocery list. There are also improvements to Meta AI responsiveness, and the company is working on real-time speech translation. On the hardware front, Meta is launching new styles like a transparent frame and a new range of transition lenses.\\nAI images in your Facebook and Instagram feeds — featuring you\\n\\nImage: Meta\\nSoon, your Facebook and Instagram feeds will include Meta AI-generated content “based on your interests or current trends” in a section called “Imagined for you.” It can incorporate your face into made-up scenarios like “an enchanted realm,” and you can do things like imagine yourself as a video game character or astronaut. The feature is a test for now.\\nMeta AI in celebrity voices\\nMeta is continuing its venture to make celeb chatbots after shutting down its alternate persona feature on Instagram, which had weird options like Tom Brady playing as “Bru.” Now, Meta is connecting new celebrities with AI versions of themselves on Meta AI, including Awkwafina, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, Kristen Bell, and Dame Judi Dench. You can get access to these Meta AI voices on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook in the US.\\nNew Llama model with image processing\\n\\nIllustration by Nick Barclay / The Verge\\nMeta has a new Llama model with one key update: the ability to process visuals. This is something competitors have had for the past year, so it’s an important step forward for Meta’s model. The new version also comes in smaller packages designed for mobile.\\n\\nSee More:\\n\\nAI\\nAR\\nMeta\\nNews\\nTech\\n\\nMore in this stream\\nSee all\\nThe kinds of devices Meta wants to make next\\nAlex HeathOct 11, 2024\\nWelcome to Meta’s future, where everyone wears cameras\\nJay PetersSep 28, 2024\\nMeta’s new smart glasses look like the future\\nDavid PierceSep 27, 2024\\nMost Popular\\nMost Popular\\n\\n\\nStarlink poised to take over $2.4 billion contract to overhaul air traffic control communication\\n\\n\\nMeta is firing about 20 employees for leaking\\n\\n\\nOpenAI announces GPT-4.5, warns it’s not a frontier AI model\\n\\n\\nPerplexity’s AI search engine can now buy products for you\\n\\n\\niPhone 16E review: Eh, it’s alright\\n\\n\\nInstaller\\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\\nEmail (required)\\nSign Up\\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Meta also reportedly invested in the company last year, solidifying that partnership, which will give Meta direct access to the company’s most popular frames and styles when developing its glasses models.\\nThe models will also, eventually, expand into fully functional AR glasses, though that’s still a little way off yet.\\nAccording to Bloomberg’s report, Meta next stage on this front will be to release its first smart glasses with a heads-up display, which are scheduled to be made available later this year.\\nThe next iteration of its Ray Ban Stories glasses (now called “Ray Ban Meta” according to Meta’s product site) will be able to deliver notifications and display photos, via the small display, that will be visible to the wearer at the lower portion of their view. It’ll also be able to run “simple” apps, though they won’t be fully AR-enabled, providing digital overlays on real-world scenes.\\nThat’s the next stage, which Meta is still planning for 2027, in order to give it more time to establish more sustainable, lower-cost production processes, which will bring down the price of the AR device.\\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was highly critical of Apple’s approach with its AR-enabled VisionPro device, noting that its $3,499 price tag is simply too high to ensure widespread adoption. Meta, instead, has been committed to driving down the costs of its own wearables to expand market reach, and it’s committed to also launching an AR device that aligns with that same principle.\\nThough its newer smart glasses will be more expensive.\\nThe model coming later this year is expected to be around double the price of the current Ray Ban Metas, while the company has also predicted that its AR-enabled glasses will eventually cost the same amount as a \\\"high end laptop or smartphone.”\\nBut Zuckerberg also expects that smart glasses will surpass smartphones in popularity and practicality within the next decade, so that cost may be easier to swallow if you’re no longer reliant on a phone. Though that will also require a significant habitual and social shift to facilitate such growth.\\nMeta is now steadily working towards such a shift, while the push to keep the costs down could also be one of the key reasons why Zuckerberg is keen to work with the incoming Trump administration, in order to avoid increased costs for its projects.\\nMany of Meta’s glasses components are sourced from China, and with Trump pledging tariffs on non-American goods, especially Chinese imports, that could put a dent in Meta’s plans.\\nBased on these latest insights, Meta is planning to begin its AR push during Trump’s presidency, which means that it will be hugely dependent on the government to ease its path through regulatory processes, in order to maximize this opportunity.\\nThat alone may be enough to justify Zuckerberg’s kowtowing to Trump, altering the company’s existing content policies to appease the president, among other compromises.\\nAnd if Zuck’s right, that very well could pay off significantly in the longer term.\\nIt won’t be popular, and it's unclear whether the negatives of this approach will outweigh the broader benefits. But for Meta itself, the path forward is clear, and it’s going to need a lot of government cooperation to aid its AI, AR and VR expansion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n purchase licensing rights\\n\\nFiled Under: Social Media Updates\\nSocial Media Today news delivered to your inbox\\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\\nEmail:       \\n\\nSelect user consent: [ ]  By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
